# What did so far

todo
- figure out images

7/2/2026

- copied the whole thing into /docs by way of download and upload, now it works
- updated nav pane, more or less
- deleted sample posts (they're now in the main under examples folder)
- attempted to make a new post. it works.
- updated "about" pages
- attempted to change homepage layout. it works. 
- added toc:true to the blog pages. it works.
- working out something with collections to make site/project info easily accessible. I guess it works.
- fuck it, too much work. we'll keep them posts and do a category:tag deal.

# Info for use

New post: copy one of the previous posts and update the header bar, fuck it. 

Tags are projects. not addresses, just "Tokoroa 1". "Farm" will probably show up at some stage. 

Categories are "updates", "project info", and "site info" so far. yet to figure out how that works 

Homepage updated: added home.md to _pages, set in the headings "permalink: /", deleted index.html

To get a right-pane TOC, add "toc: true" to the headings, or to the config.yml default

You can use \<br> inside of markdown quoted text. 

(not tested: you can use "pin: true" to get a pinned post)
