# What does Bob do?

Bob purchases properties and makes them more properties. (How's that for a one-line summary?)

I look for standalone houses on large sections, where the house is positioned in such a way that another house can be placed on the section. Then I place another house on the section. In the process of doing so, I make an awful lot of money. (Okay, three sentences, is that better?)
