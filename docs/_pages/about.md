# What does Mog do?

Mog purchases properties and makes them more properties. (How's that for a one-line summary?)

I look for standalone houses on large sections, where the house is positioned in such a way that another house can be placed on the section. Then I place another house on the section. In the process of doing so, I make an awful lot of money. (Okay, three sentences, is that better?)

# How does that work?

1. Buy a house, with land
2. Buy another house, without land
3. Move house onto land
4. Profit

We can break that down further. And you want to know where your lending goes, right? 

### 1. Buy a house, with land

   The S&P "standard" deposit is 10%. Even in Tokoroa, that's a good 30-40 grand. Typically I do not carry this much cash around, but it'll come back around on settlement day. (Typically I also try to get away with a 5-10k deposit instead of 10%, which I do carry around, but that doesn't always work.) 

### 2. Buy another house, without land

   First there is a deposit to hold the house. This can be 30% of 100k, which is another 30 grand. I still don't carry this much cash around, but luckily I still have the last 30k you lent me, right? 

### 3. Move house onto land

   The house has to be paid for (mostly) up front before it's shifted. (Depending on the company, they may or may not be OK with a contract that says last 5% after it's tied to piles. But that's still 95% of 100k.) I really, really don't carry this much cash around. So I borrow the other 65-70k off of you.
   
   I also incurred some expenses getting to this point, like surveying, drafting, and site prep. Those I may or may not have managed to cover out of pocket, and if I didn't, then I'll get you to foot the bill for them too. 

### 4. Profit

   Now that the house is on the land, the bank will finally lend on it! I borrow all the money I owe you at bank rates, so I can stop paying hard money rates. 

### 5. Repeat

   I mean, you didn't really expect me to stop at one house?
