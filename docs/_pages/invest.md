These are the terms of the hard money investment deal offered by Mog. 

Summary: 12%pa, compounded monthly, paid out either monthly or all at once when returning the base capital. 

You can follow project updates on this site to see where your money is being put to use. 

If you want 20%pa instead, I can go find the guy who does that. But it's not me. 

## Details
You lend me money. Once-off, ad-hoc, whatever we agree on. 

Every month on the 15th, I repay you 1% of the highest borrowing value in the last month. Or it's added on to the total repayments due at the end instead, if you choose that option. 

You can ask for the money back, but everything is "best effort", except at milestones that pretty much correspond to me being able to get more money out of the bank. Typically they're about 4-6 months apart, and I can tell you the next upcoming one and a time estimate for it. 

If I'm done with your money and want to return it, I will let you know when I know, which is probably a few weeks to a few months' notice. It will come back to you by the 15th of the month following a milestone date, along with the final interest payment. 

## Fine print

Fractional cents are rounded down in my favour when calculating repayments on the 15th of the month. 

Lending is in NZD; any exchange rate risks and fees are on you to manage. 

If I want to return the money, but you'd rather delay the return (hoping that exchange rates will improve in your favour, or whatever), the interest rate during that period is 0%. 

# Invest with Mog

The traditional method of splitting a joint venture is one person fronts all the money, and the other one fronts all the effort, and the profits are split 50/50. 

I'm the one with the effort. That means you're the one with the money. 

For a 50/50 split, your minimum entry point is something like $250k for the first round, and $120k per round thereafter. Exact figures depending on location. If you're coming in with less, then I have to bring some of the money in addition to all the effort, so the final profit split will favour me. 

Alternatively, your entry point can include property you want developed in some way; we can figure out something that works. (Money is still required to develop the property! Just not $250k liquid of it.)
