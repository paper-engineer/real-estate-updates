# About this project

This house was purchased as a half-completed renovation project in a good area of town. The plan is to put another house on the back yard, and potentially subdivide it. 

# Purchase evaluation

Key drawcards
- address (excellent)
- condition of house (fine except that it was half-renovated)
- price (very sharp)
- size of section (very large)
- vendor motivation (they just wanted out, instead of finishing the few renovations left)

Caveats
- flood zone
- access for relocation
- competition (multi offer deadline one week from listing date!)
- easements and utilities creating restrictions on building
- on-street parking is awful because of the commercial neighbours

Due diligence suggested that the obstacles were not insurmountable, and my evaluation was that it was profitable at listing price. If it wasn't multi-offer, I would probably have taken another 5-10k off just because. But it was, so I stuck my usual odd-number-extra-money onto the listing price, and added a high deposit and quick settlement. No conditions - took a calculated risk on the building report - everything else I already DD'd on my own. I'm told I wasn't the highest offer, but it was a clean offer.
