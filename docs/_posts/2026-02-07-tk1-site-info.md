Section size: 980m2 (more or less)

The current plan includes the following: 
- Remove the second garage (light blue roof, 5m x 6m). 
- Move the first garage (3.6m x 7m) back. 
- Put a new-to-me house on the corner with the high ground. 
- Potentially add a cabin/sleepout, possibly with attached bathroom, to be used as an extra bedroom for higher rent. Of course, the final layout will depend on the selected house for relocation. 

*I'm planning to live in the cabin on weekdays(ish) for work during the project! This factors into my calculations! 

# What I'm looking for in a house
This is considered a good part of town, so I'd like a good-quality house to put on it: 3 or more bedrooms in 90+ m2 would be ideal, with space for a second toilet. I am open to two-piece shifts and/or houses requiring some renovations. I'm willing to consider house-only sales and arrange my own removal. 

My total working budget for the house and move is, I think, on the order of $100k plus GST, after the cabin; so maybe $115k+GST total if the cabin turns out not to be necessary. This doesn't include renovations - the total cost including renovations may exceed that amount, but that will also factor into house selection. (Good part of town or not, it's still Tokoroa and I don't need to overcapitalise.) It also doesn't include surveying, drafting, consenting, etc. 

# Access notes
- The space between existing house and the building next door is ~8m, wide enough to fit some shoeboxes. I measured 6.8m from my eaves to next door's fence, and there's a metre or two between next door's fence and its eaves (not measured in person). This access has no curb cut and is not suitable for a legal driveway. 
- Trees will be cut back or removed to fit a house through. 
- The fence in the lower left corner is ~6.3m from the house at the closest approach, and is ~1.6m high. I understand there are options (lift the house above the fence, reinstate it at my cost after the move, or the right two-piece shift may bypass the issue entirely), but the cost and convenience of the required option will factor into house selection. 

# Planning caveats
- Section is partly in a rainfall 100-year flood zone, so the paperwork to approve the relocated build will be a bit fiddly and we'll probably need higher piles than normal.
- Stormwater sump location precludes any new driveway on that side of the house
- Wastewater lines passing under section - limitations to structures around front house
