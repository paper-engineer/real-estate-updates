# commentary

Lorem ipsum, etc. Hi guys. 

Where I'm at: settling on the 18th. house is loaded with blackberries. meeting with council on the 11th. sent out emails to house companies. did you know there are a couple of guys on fb marketplace selling houses without websites? TIL, anyway. 

separately, I now have a more-or-less comprehensive list of house removal companies in nz. woohoo. yard sale bargain hunting time I guess. 

# project status
- builder arranged, waiting on quotes/estimates
- insurance hopefully working on it
- bank finance locked in @ 4.4% for 1yr
- deposit paid out of hard money, it'll come back around in the bank finance
- looking for houses to place
- access and stuff determined
- council meeting arranged

# upcoming challenges
- still TBC about work and airbnb
- dunno where the money situation is at. depending on how much site works are projected to cost, I'll have to work out which further renos to put off until house2 is on piles, and also probably get a cheaper house2 and renovate on site (often less efficient compared to a fully renovated house2, but my options are limited by price and available financing)
