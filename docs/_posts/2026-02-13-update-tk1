# Signing

It's almost official, I have signed the paperwork to settle. 

# Insurance 

I love my insurance broker! He has such lovely inside knowledge like "insurers are getting reluctant to cover relocatables now, unless you have existing business with them" and "insurers get a bit weird around self-contained-ish cabins". 

# Meeting with Council...as expected

I had such high hopes, you know? Arranged a meeting with the engineer, planner and someone from the building consents team. Only the planner turned up - at a meeting which the time was set by the engineer! 

Got some usable info around subdivision, at least, but nothing immediately actionable. Now to chase all my required info via email. Good luck to me. 

## Everything but the kitchen sink

I'm told council considers the kitchen sink to be the difference between a self-contained unit and not. TBC how that plays with insurance, but there are options. Have I mentioned I love my insurance broker?

# On the hunt

I'm now ranking house moving companies by whether they read my email thoroughly or not. Among other things. Also working on my process and checklists - next project ought to be quite a lot smoother. Site info page has been updated to include the results of my newly implemented process (the pictures are prettier), and a site visit measurement (yay, I have a whole 6.8m to the neighbour's fence.)
