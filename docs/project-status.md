- copied the whole thing into /docs by way of download and upload, now it works
- updated nav pane, more or less
- deleted sample posts (they're now in the main under examples folder)
- attempted to make a new post. it works.
- updated "about" pages
- attempted to change homepage layout. hmmm.

# Info for use

New post: copy one of the previous posts and update the header bar, fuck it. 

Tags are projects. not addresses, just "Tokoroa 1". "Farm" will probably show up at some stage. 

Categories are "updates" and "info", so far.
