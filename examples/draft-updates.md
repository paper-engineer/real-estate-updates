As it turns out, someone working full time finds it very difficult to make it to a house yard 2.5 hours away during work hours for viewings. 

*Path of Building player enters stage left*

*A Planning & Development Assistant has been added to the team for this project.* 

# Meeting with Council...as expected

I had such high hopes, you know? Arranged a meeting with the engineer, planner and someone from the building consents team. Only the planner turned up - at a meeting which the time was set by the engineer! 

Got some usable info around subdivision, at least, but nothing immediately actionable. Now to chase all my required info via email.

# Team

I wouldn't be anywhere without Wayne from iFindProperty. Thanks for introducing me to Ian from WOW Renovations too. Wow indeed. 

Craig at Kiwibank lives up to his bio on the website. 

Chris, the #1 house insurance guy in NZ, needs no introduction from me and I'll recommend him to everyone all day. 

The good folks at SWDC have been all in from day one. 

Looking forward to working with Fiona from RentAssured. 

Upcoming: surveyor, house mover, assistant, geotech...
