tell me about these houses

- hhr248: t1/2 located helensville, 7400 wide x 13500. pending viewing to confirm renos, prob needs rangehood. 77392+gst=89k, renos ???
- trh glenfield: t1 located glenfield, 7800 wide should be fine. needs bathroom reconfig and raise entryway, then fix floor and add carpet. p sure needs rangehood. 26500+tpt maybe 80k+, renos 30k?
- trh highland: t1/2 located manukau, 8300 wide may be hard to move in. similar renos needed to hhr248, kitchen bathroom paint carpet. 40k+tpt=90k at a first guess, renos 40k
- trh avondale: same layout as other t1 boxes but fully renovated, although 6800 wide and bit longer. 125k (please try to make it house only though)
- em747: pending plans

- pbr173: t1 villa, minor kitchen, bathroom reconfig, carpet. 96k, renos 30k
- pbr140: t1/2 (pending renos) cheap, renos expensive
- pbr168: t2.5 ditto
- pbr116: t2-2.5 ditto

- wbr villa: t2, needs reconfig but it's too nice to tear apart, 105k
- rhl new lynn: t2 relatively cheap, renos expensive

well, there is a clear winner. and it's in fkn glenfield. I literally cannot get up there at any reasonable hour of any day in the next two and a half weeks. 

walk through a similar plan, uhhh no similar at pbr, 140 is closest. maybe similars but expensive expensive? that is a tomorrow problem. 

then call myles on monday and uh. nope, I gotta do fkn work.

therefore the thing to do is

go pbr. view all of the above, just for shits and giggles. 

go to akl. view trh boxes, fenton hhr248, maybe em747. 

most likely choose one of these

if not, then we'll start picking through t2s and calling no-plans-provided folks.

so where are we at?

let's make an Actual Shortlist

t1: trh glenfield, fenton hhr248 | pbr 173 (140?), em747 pending plan

these are the almost-just-drop-in ones which barely need a reno even. this is uh some boxes and a villa. there is also apparently an ideal box configuration and layout to include cabin (it's horizontal except for pbr140 which it's vertical). 

t2: trh highland, pbr 140 168 116, wbr villa, rhl well maintained, trh avondale, the one private sale, rhl new lynn

these take a bit of reconfiguration (168) or renovation (140 116, pending viewing) but end up nice (ish), or less work but not quite great. we have a T, a front-on almost-shoebox, a bungalow, and two not quite boxes/Ls. now separated in pptcad to t2-1 and t2-2. we won't go further with it unless for some reason t1s don't work out. 

t3: cwbr listings, bop209, anything without a floor plan who also didn't email me back, trh kinloch and blockhouse, the really difficult pbrs 121 159 138

these are expensive, small, or not economical. I mean check the pbrs out anyway while I'm there, but yeah. .

house list

easymoves em743 was rec'd but it's the wrong config, em747 pending plan

fenton as rec'd by karl, HHR 274 (floorplan wack) / 248 (suitable) / 276 (no floorplan) / 267 (wrong layout)

pbrs - 159 (major reconfiguration required) / 140 (8.3 wide may be an issue and layout not great) / 138 (needs major reconfig) / 116 (some repairs, reconfigurations and a whole birthday) / 121 (needs major reconfig and major repairs) / 173 (bungalow slightly too wide to be optimal) / 168 (needs reclad, minor reconfigure)

rhl has two total suitable between their tm and website - both are on my pptcad already and I think both located akl

wbr has the smith if I was going to do a huge reno, and one solid maybe tm listing https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/property/residential/sale/waikato/hamilton/hamilton-east/listing/5732387427

cwbr listings are plus gst and seems relatively expensive - suitable houses - owen at 100k, eve at 95k, ollie at 69k, susie at 95k - nope I don't think I can get good value out of it

bop209 archie, if nothing else, but I think pbr has better

trh: 15 kinloch is a bit small but it fits, 24 glenfield perfectly dimensioned barely needs updating https://trhco.co.nz/properties/24glenfield/ it's like the private sale one but better except for the entry door, 8 blockhouse bay has some potential but small, 16 highland park isn't terrible but doesn't win awards, 18 avondale https://trhco.co.nz/properties/18avondale/ but try for house-only, and charmer was on my trademe watchlist but idk if it'll actually fit since the new process https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/property/residential/sale/waikato/matamata-piako/morrinsville/listing/5763209461

randle's on the truck might work but they don't do house plans https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/property/residential/sale/auckland/waitakere-city/glendene/listing/5658087527
